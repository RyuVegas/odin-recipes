            <li><b>When the rice is at low fire</b>, we will start cooking the chicken
                <ol>

                    <li>Stir it for the chicken to get cooked</li>
                    <li>Once you removed the chicken you can add a little more Curcuma if you want</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            
            <li>Mix the chicken and the rice on a plate</li>
