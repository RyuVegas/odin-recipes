    <p>It may seem like there are a lot of ingredients but do not let them fool you, it is as easy as it can get to cook them.<br><br>Now <b>I will show you the steps:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Let's start with the rice
            <ol>
                <li>put some oil inside the pot</li>
                <li>Put as much glasses of rice as you want</li>
                <li>Put the rice in the pot</li>
                <li>Put water in the pot (double the amount of water glasses than rice glasses)</li>
                <li>Put the pot on the stove</li>
                <li>Add some salt</li>
                <li>Wait until the rice is cooked<br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>7 minutes high fire (above 95ºC, boiling water)</li>
                        <li>15 minutes low fire (below 50ºC)</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Once is cooked add some Curcuma longa and stir it</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>When the rice is at low fire</b>, we will start cooking the chicken
            <ol>
                <li>First <strong>cut the chicken into stripes</strong></li>
                <li>Put some oil in the pan</li>
                <li>Put the chicken stripes in the pan</li>
                <li>Add a little salt to the chicken</li>
                <li>Stir it for the chicken to get cooked</li>
                <li>Once you removed the chicken you can add a little more Curcuma if you want</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Once you got the chicken and the rice cooked, you mix it in a plate</li>
        <li>Stir it a little and there you go, you got the most delicious plate you will ever eat</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As you can see it is not a difficult dish to cook and believe me when I say, it is the most delicious dish ever.</p>
