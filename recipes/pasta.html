    <p>Macaroni is one of the easiest dishes to cook ever, although most people know how to make macaroni, I'm going to explain it anyways.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: large;"><b>Here are the ingredients you should have:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Macaroni</li>
        <li>Pot</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Fried tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Grated cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-size: large;"><b>Now let's go to the cooking part:</b></p>

    <ol>
        <li>First, take a pot and fill it with water</li>
        <li>Put the pot on the stove and let it heat</li>
        <li>Once the water is boiling, add the macaroni</li>
        <li>Let it cook at least for 8 minutes</li>
        <li>Once the macaroni is cooked, take it out of the pot and put it on a plate</li>
        <li>Add the fried tomato sauce and the grated cheese as well as some mushrooms, sausage and marjoram if you like</li>
        <li>Stir it all together and you are ready to eat</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>There you go, <em>a delicious plate</em> that took you less than 15 minutes</p>
